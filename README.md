# Data Science Portfolio
This repository contains portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic and self learning purposes. The projects are presented as ipython notebooks.

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning

     - [Supervised Learning: Predicting Boston Housing Prices](https://github.com/akshayarane/data_science_portfolio/tree/master/boston_housing/boston_housing.ipynb): Predict the best selling value of a given house for a client in the Boston area using various features available for the house and machine learning models.
     - [Supervised Learning: Finding Donors for Charity](https://github.com/akshayarane/data_science_portfolio/tree/master/finding_donors/finding_donors.ipynb): Predict whether an individual earns more than $50,000 using marital status, education, age etc to identify likely donors for a fictitious non-profit organization.
     - [Unsupervised Learning: Creating Customer Segments](https://github.com/akshayarane/data_science_portfolio/tree/master/customer_segments/customer_segments.ipynb): Analyzed a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts of diverse product categories to equip the distributor with insight into how to best structure their delivery service.
     - [Deep Learning: Identifying an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed using CNN](https://github.com/akshayarane/data_science_portfolio/tree/master/dog-project/dog_app.ipynb): Designing and implementing a Convolutional Neural Network that learns to identify canine breed given an image of a dog. If given image of a human, the algorithm identifies a resembling dog breed.
     - [Reinforcement Learning: Training a Quadcopter How to Fly!](https://github.com/akshayarane/data_science_portfolio/tree/master/RL-Quadcopter-2/Quadcopter_Project.ipynb): Designing an optimized Q-Learning agent that can train and fly a quadcopter through its environment.
     - [Supervised Learning: Predicting Bike rental demand in the city](https://github.com/akshayarane/data_science_portfolio/tree/master/bike-share/project_report.pdf): Predicting Bike rental demand in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington D.C. using historical usage data, weather information, and annual holidays.
