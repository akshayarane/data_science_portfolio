- ### Machine Learning

     - [Supervised Learning: Predicting Boston Housing Prices]( https://github.com/akshayarane/Udacity-ML-Nanodegree/tree/master/projects/boston_housing): Predict the best selling value of a given house for a client in the Boston area using various features available for the house and machine learning models.
     - [Supervised Learning: Finding Donors for Charity](): Predict whether an individual earns more than $50,000 using marital status, education, age etc to identify likely donors for a fictitious non-profit organization.
     - [Unsupervised Learning: Creating Customer Segments](): Analyzed a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts of diverse product categories to equip the distributor with insight into how to best structure their delivery service.
     - [Deep Learning: Identifying an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed using CNN](): Designing and implementing a Convolutional Neural Network that learns to identify canine breed given an image of a dog. If given image of a human, the algorithm identifies a resembling dog breed.
     - [Reinforcement Learning: Training a Quadcopter How to Fly!](): Designing an optimized Q-Learning agent that can train and fly a quadcopter through its environment.
